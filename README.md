This code goes along with a presentation for a computer methods in meteorology class.
To first run the code there is an import list at the beggining of the code.
The data that will be imported will be various streamflow rivers, cru precipitaion data, and PDSI data.

The first segment of code plots a spatial plot of the CRU precipitation data. This covers the entire untited states. 

The second segment of the code is the same precipitation spatial plot with the outline of the MRB to show what precipitation is like within the basin.

The thrid segmemt of code uses the same precipition and MRB outline to and adds the station markers on the map. 

The forth segment covers lines 144 to 324 in the code. This segment shows a tedious process of coding the correlation between streamflow at each station and PDSI.

After this there will be 3 segments of codes all very similar. THese 3 all plot the time series of streamflow discharge at each of the stations. The only difference between the 3 is the station name and input staition.

The final block of code makes a time series of the precipitation and adds a trendline for data.

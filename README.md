This code goes along with a presentation for a computer methods class in meteorology. At the beginning of the code, there is an import list to run it first. The data that will be imported will be various streamflow rivers, cru precipitation data, and PDSI data.

The first code segment plots a spatial map of the CRU precipitation data, covering the entire United States.

The second segment of the code uses the same precipitation spatial plot with the outline of the MRB to show precipitation within the basin.

The third segment of the code uses the same precipitation and MRB outline and adds the station markers on the map.

The fourth segment covers lines 144 to 324 in the code. It shows the tedious process of coding the correlation between streamflow at each station and PDSI.

After this, there will be three segments of codes, all very similar. These three plot the time series of streamflow discharge at each of the stations. The only difference between the three is the station name and input station.

The final block of code makes a time series of the precipitation and adds a trendline for data.
